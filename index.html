 <h2>About Us</h2>
 <p>The Akimbo eSports team was founded in mid 2019, it has been in great tournaments starting in 2020.
	This team has had 15 major competitions and countless competitions since then.
	Original founder, Gavin Bunnell, is the head of the team and brought everybody together.
	The team started out as a small friend group who played games every day. We believe in good morals
	and not being grumpy from a lost game.</p><br>
<p> We believe that its in the best interest that we keep the games that we play to a low number.
    The big two games that we have the most focus in is, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 'CS:GO'
	and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. These games hold some of our highest skilled players on the team.
	footage can be found under the Games tag at Gameplay.</p><br>
