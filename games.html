	<h2>Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
	<p>Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Siege was the start of the team. The team only played Rainbow Six until it expanded. There is still room for expansion but every game is voted on by the team members. There are only a select few games that are played at a time.<br>
		Rainbow Six siege is played by two sides, the defense and the attackers. The defence side has to defend either hostage or the bomb site. If the attackers manage to plant the bomb or take the hostage, there is only a limited amount of time for the defence to gain control again. If the attackers
		manage to take the hostages back to their extraction point, then the attackers win, if they manage to plant the bomb and it isnt defused, then the attackers win. The Defence wins if they secure the hostages or if they prevent the bomb from being planted/exploding.</p><br>
	<img src="logos/csgo.png" alt="Counter-Strike: Global Offensive" style="width:256px;" />
	<h2>Counter-Strike Global Offensive</h2>
	<p>Counter-Strike Global Offensive was the second game added to the team. Rainbow Six and counter strike are both similar games when it comes to the style.<br>
	Counter Strike is played as a 5v5. There are two teams, Terrorists<span>&#x28;T&#41;</span> and Counter Terrorists<span>&#x28;CT&#41;</span>. The objective of playing as CT is to defend the bomb area. There are two bomb locations on the map so the team is required to split up and requires great communication.
	T side has to plant the bomb. If the bomb explodes then the Terrorists win. If the Counter Terrorists manage to defuse the bomb, then the Counter Terrorists win.</p><br>
	<img src="logos/halo.png" alt="Halo" style="width:256px;" />
	<h2>Halo: Master Chief Collection</h2>
	<p>Halo: Master Chief Collection is a new edition to the team. We very recently started playing and just got enough people to volunteer to be on the team.<br>
		Halo: Master Chief Collection consists of 5 multiplayer halo games, Halo CE, 2, 3, Reach, and 4. We only play Halo Reach and 4 competitively. The game is simple and its just a fight until one team reaches 50 points. Each kill is 1 point so the games are relativaly quick.
